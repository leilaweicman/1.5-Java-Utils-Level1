# 1.5-Java-Utils-Level1

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project contains the solution to the following Java exercises:

### Exercise 1
Create a class that lists alphabetically the contents of a directory received as a parameter.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `DirectoryLister`:
  - Validates that the directory exists and is valid.
  - Prints the directory contents alphabetically.
  - Handles the case of empty or invalid directories.

### Exercise 2
Extend the previous class to list a **directory tree recursively**, including all subdirectories.  
For each entry, print:
- Whether it is a directory `(D)` or a file `(F)`.
- The last modified date.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `RecursiveDirectoryLister`:
  - Traverses all subdirectories recursively.
  - Sorts contents alphabetically within each directory.
  - Shows indentation for each level of depth.
  - Prints the last modified timestamp for each entry.

### Exercise 3
Modify the previous class so that the result is saved in a **TXT file** instead of being displayed on the console.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `RecursiveDirectoryListerToFile`:
  - Writes the directory tree structure to an `output.txt` file.
  - Uses a global constant to configure the output file path.
  - Maintains alphabetical ordering and recursion as in Exercise 2.

### Exercise 4
Add the functionality to **read any TXT file** and print its contents to the console.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `TxtFileReader`:
  - Reads a `.txt` file line by line with `BufferedReader`.
  - Validates that the file exists and is not empty.
  - Prints its content to the console.

### Exercise 5
Serialize a Java object into a `.ser` file and then deserialize it back.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `Person` class:
  - Implements `Serializable`.
  - Contains fields `name` and `age`.
- `ObjectSerialization`:
  - Serializes a `Person` object into `person.ser`.
  - Deserializes the file back into a `Person` instance.
  - Demonstrates that original and deserialized objects match.
